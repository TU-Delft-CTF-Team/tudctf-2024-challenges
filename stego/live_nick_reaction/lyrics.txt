"More Layers in Sight/The Nick Jazz"
Verse 1
Nick's in Delft, in the glow of the screen,
Solving puzzles at the CTF scene.
He’s digging deep in an image so sly,
Hidden data, but it’s just a lie.

Pre-Chorus
Oh, it's cursed, and it's cruel,
Another layer in this hacker's duel.
He's losing his mind in this endless chase,
But Nick knows he can't just leave this place.

Chorus
With even more layers in sight, oh, he’s going insane,
Petting his coati, but it don’t ease the pain.
Every code he cracks just reveals some more,
It's a labyrinth of secrets, and it's eating at his core.

Verse 2
His coati looks up with those gentle eyes,
But even the coati can't sympathize.
The clock is ticking, his mind's a maze,
Stuck in this endless, digital haze.

Pre-Chorus
Oh, it's dark and it's deep,
This rabbit hole, it’s stealing his sleep.
But Nick’s a fighter, he won’t back down,
Even when this code's got him wearing a frown.

Chorus
With even more layers in sight, oh, he’s going insane,
Petting his coati, but it don’t ease the pain.
Every code he cracks just reveals some more,
It's a labyrinth of secrets, and it's eating at his core.

Bridge
Then he heads to Echo, where the lights are dim,
Sees George in his office, Nick's looking grim.
"Need a coffee, man, just one little sip,"
George hands his card with a knowing grip.

Verse 3
That free cup of coffee, oh, it's magic, it's sweet,
A boost to his spirit, he's back on his feet.
Sips it slow, feeling strong once again,
Now he's back in the game, Nick's gonna win.

Chorus
He’s tearing through layers with renewed might,
Coffee in hand, oh, now he's feeling right.
One by one, the secrets unfold,
Nick's on fire, feeling brave and bold.

Outro
Layers in the night, oh, now they’re coming clear,
Nick’s got the strength, there’s nothing to fear.
With a coati by his side and that coffee so free,
He cracks the final flag, oh, sweet victory.
