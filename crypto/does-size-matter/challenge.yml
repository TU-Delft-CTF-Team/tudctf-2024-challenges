description: I encrypted the flag with RSA, but my secret primes are not really the
  same size. Does it really matter? To solve this challenge, it's recommended do download
  PyCryptodome. The flag is a string, but it was encoded into a number usable in the
  cipher using the function `bytes_to_long`.
