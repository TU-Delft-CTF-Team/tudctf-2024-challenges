description: The Marmot Intelligence, Informatics, Intervention, Investigation & Interception
  Institute (MI6) intercepted network traffic between members of Coati Intelligence
  Agency (CIA) using a multi-signature scheme to sign important messages. What the
  coatis don't know is that their implementation of the algorithm includes a backdoor
  planted by an agent of MI6. Now, as part of the Operation Marmots vs Multisignatures
  (Operation MVM), the marmots want to recover the private key of coati agent with
  ID `5e547334-68c1-4ca2-9748-57f560372648`. Help them perform this task so that they
  can impersonate the coati agents later!
