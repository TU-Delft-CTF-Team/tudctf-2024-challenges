description: We found even more very old routers at [LOCATION REDACTED]. This time
  we didn't have a JTAG cable, so we couldn't dump the firmware. At least we could
  connect to the admin panel, if we could crack the wifi password... Given the frames
  we collected during the attack, can you recover the key? The flag is the key represented
  as hexadecimal digits with capital letters wrapped in TUDCTF{} (i.e., if the key
  (in ASCII) is "?@ABC", the flag is "TUDCTF{3F40414243}").
