description: 'One of TU Delft''s hackers (codename: "Agent 0xba115") managed to infiltrate
  internal network of De Haagse Hogeschool and download a repository containing source
  code of a critical piece of their infrastracture. Unfortunately, he spilled a free
  coffee acquired using [REDACTED]''s employee card over his laptop and lost all his
  data. Luckily, we still have a dump of network communication between his machine
  and HHs git server. Can you help us recover the secrets hidden in that repository?'
